be immediately expelled. Per national policy, proactive prevention of these acts
will be done by holding a sexual misconduct presentation once a semester with
all members prior to the first social event following the recruitment period and
another risk management presentation throughout the presentation. If alleged
sexual misconduct occurs, another sexual misconduct prevention presentation will
occur. Presentations for sexual misconduct and risk management will be conducted
using University of Michigan resources such as SAPAC and CAPS. In addition to
this chapter policy, we will follow all University of Michigan and national
Lambda Chi Alpha policies regarding sexual misconduct. If a member is accused of
alleged sexual misconduct, we will follow the judiciary procedure set by our
nationals in Article 7 Sections 4-6 of our national constitution for internal
judiciary procedures and we will follow the University of Michigan’s sexual
misconduct policy as well.
